## State: 
  I am currently not stuck on anything

## Progress:
  This week I attended the SoCET meeting learning about the internship experiences others had, how they realted to SoCET, and what helped them get into the positions 
  they did.
  
  Furthermore, I attended the individual AI hardware subteam meeting where the scheduling sub group met and began to talk about the basics of the design and what steps
  need to be taken going forward to ensure a sucessful semester.

  I learned about the indivdual functional units and how they contribute to the overall design, and the ISA we will be implementing to ensure they work smoothly. I also learned
  about the vector unit and the array, how they work, and where the scheduler fits into their operation.
  
  I was given documentation on the high level RTL digrams to review and also shown the system verilog code to review.

## Next Steps:
  I plan to continue to learn as much as I can about the current design from the RTL diagrams and the system verilog code. This Sunday I will take any questions I have to out work
  time so they can be worked out with the rest of the team. In the coming weeks I will begin to architect the new design to support the updated ISA.
