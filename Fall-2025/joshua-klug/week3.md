## State: 
  I am currently not stuck on anything

## Progress:
  This week I attended the AI hardware work meeting on sunday where I continued to ask questions and learn about the current implimentation of the scheduler.
  This Tuesday I attended the scheduler subteam meeting where I was assigned my role for the year, working on the issue and dispatch stages of the pipeline which
  are mostly made up of the scoreboard components.
  This Thursday I bag to map out and digram the current implementation, I started with the register status tables, sepcifically the scalar one, but from what ive learned
  in the code they are not that different. It is all in a drawio I will leave a link to it below. This also left me with a couple unanswered questions about some of the design choices that were made.
  I also finished my PD plan and intro lecture for senior design VIP and submitted those, outlining what steps I will take for the coming semester to complete my senior design requirments in the PD plan.
  I attended the Thursday meeting and listened to the presentations that were given.

## Next Steps:
  Next week I will continue to deconstruct and diagram the existing code so I can better understand how it works.
  I will also get to gether with my team and discuss and complete the project proposal due on monday.
  I will continue to attend all the events and learn as much as I can about the project.
