## Project Overview: 
-I will be working on the scheduler for the AI hardware team. Specifically, we will be using a scoreboard to implement out of order instruction execution. Due to the nature of the systolic array operations taking many clock cycles and having their own hardware, we are able to fetch new instructions and execute them while the systolic array is still working. 

## Semester Goals: 
-Realize out of order execution in hardware 
-Create a scoreboard to keep track of what hardware is being used and what is free 
-Optimize the scheduler for new ISAs including a 64 bit ISA 
-Testbench and verify correct functionality of the scheduler 
-Integrate the scheduler with other components to test the system as a whole (not sure if this will be possible with the timeline) 

## Timeline: 
-Need to meet with my group for more information before I can give a timeline 

## Week 1 
Sub-team: AI hardware 
Team-Lead: Sooraj Chetput 
Project Overview: noted above 
When do you meet? Main SoCET: Thursday 5:30pm. Sub-team: Thursday right after the Main meeting ends 
How do I reach my lead? Email, discord, or sharepoint 

I have no idea what I am supposed to do for week 1, I did what it saind in the email and in the slides
