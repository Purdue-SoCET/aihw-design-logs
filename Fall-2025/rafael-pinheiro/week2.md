State: I am not stuck with anything, don't need help right now.

Progress:

    - Attended Jing's focus group. Reviewed what Sooraj told us to read about (pipelining, caching, etc).
    - Attended scratchpad's onboarding meeting
      - I'll be working on the Scratchpad's frontend to the Systolic Array
        - i.e. getting data from the Scratchpad memory and sending it to the Systolic Arrays, which will realize GEMMs and convolutions using Scratchpad data.

Next steps:
    - Read links Akshath sent us about Swizzling (crucial!), GEMMs, convolutions
    - Play around with the convolution simulator
    - Reverse engineer the algorithm for swizzling
