SD2 - DRAM Controller
The DRAM controller aims to give SoCET processors access to DDR memory. A blocking, sequential version
of DDR4 controller is beign designed. It handles all requests one-by-one without any overlap. An RTL diagram
and single read and write RTL code were done last semester in Spring 2025. This semester, the blocking
implementation is to be completed and tested.

Plan for this semester
sept - RTL implementation and verification of individual modules
oct  - Combining modules for complete implementation. Testing of the complete design
nov  - Synthesis and reiterate design to meet the ddr4 clock requirements 
dec  - Report and final documentation
