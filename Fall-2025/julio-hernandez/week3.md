## Project Update

### State: I am not currently stuck or blocked.

### Progress
1. Attended the Sunday Scratchpad meeting.
2. Had a discussion on how swizzling works and why it's needed.
3. Started looking at the swizzling simulator and worked through examples.

### Next Steps
1. Develop the  RTL and Microarch diagrams for the backend prefetcher.
2. Read more on Swizzling.
3. Discuss with the other subteams to get a grasp on the signals going to the backend end and what signals need to come out.
