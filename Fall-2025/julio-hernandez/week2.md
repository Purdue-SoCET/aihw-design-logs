## Project Update

**State:** I am not currently stuck or blocked.

### Progress
1. Attended the Scratchpad meeting.
2. Got assigned to the backend portion of the scratchpad.
3. Went over a rough timeline detailing what should be done and when.

### Next Steps
1. Attend the Sunday meeting to go over what exactly I will be designing and how it fits with the rest of the team.
2. Read some papers about the scratchpad and more specifically about the backend portion.
