Design Log Week 2:

I am not stuck at this point of time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Progress:

Got an email response from Jonathan, he has forwarded the message to Dr. J and I am awaiting brightspace access as of right now.

Now know that I am going to be working on verfication for the vector core team. Got to meet the team members I will be working with along with the timeline we are aiming towards. I may edit this to note down the exact timeline later on or add it to my week 3 notes.

Current Goal: To learn more about C++ and get a bit of a refresher before the meeting on Sunday. During the meeting on Sunday my goal is to start working on the verification on one of the function unit for the vector "core" if one is finished. If not then I will ask for assistance from one of my team members on what to review and if there are any examples on what I should be expected to write for the testbenches. Any coding standard or such, any specific test cases I should be including for certain, etc.
