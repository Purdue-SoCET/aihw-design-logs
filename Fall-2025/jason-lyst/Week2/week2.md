## State: 
    I am currenlty not stuck with anything, but as of today (September 5th), I am unsure how we will coordinate our work and access the tools and build system for our project. Ok, jk, I feel kind of stuck with the Micron Simulator because I am not sure where to find it and how to use it, I would like to figure that out as soon as possible.

    <ins>Major blocker: I cannot access asicfab.</ins> 

## Week 2 Progress:
   ### September 5th:
        I am currently studying in-depth DRAM protocols, particularly DDR4, by reading the JEDEC JESD79-4 standards. Additionally, I have read chapters 10-13 of "Memory Systems" by Jacob, Ng, and Wang, which was recommended to my be Dhruv. 
        My goal for the rest of the week is to continue reading and taking notes, while also beginning to read and understand the team's RTL, block, and state machine diagrams from last semester.
    ### September 7th through September 11th:
        Continued reading through the twelfth and thirteenth chaptres of the "Memory Systems" book. I have a much better understanding of the how the controller will interface with the DRAM, and the timing constraints involved (this is currently the most immediate issue with our group). 

## Near Future Goals:
    ### September 12th:
        Finish reading the JDEC standards for DDR4 protocol. 
    ### September 14th:
        Understand our current DRAM controller designs, verify timing constraints, and help bring our current design to a successful simulation on the Micron Simulator.
    ### Septembr 21st:
        Have a state machine and rtl diagram for the updating controller, which will allow for interleaving between accessing the DRAM controller banks. 
    ### October 5th:
        Have working SystemVerilog code for the non-blocking controller ready for debugging.
