## SoCET Meeting Notes
In the intro meeting I was very excited to hear about the new projects. As a returning student I was already familiar with the SoCET subteams and overall big picture. Something cool I learned was the project involving implementing the *habitable planet* algorithm on an FPGA, which I thought was a very cool application.

## Content
Today was the first week back, which involved a focus on review from last semester.  
- I reviewed the slide deck, RTL diagrams, and full documentation before the subteam meeting so I could clearly articulate the scope of the work.  
- With new team members joining, I plotted several different project ideas, though the scope is not finalized since I am not fully briefed on the new architecture changes.

## Subteam Information
- **Subteam:** AI Hardware  
- **Lead:** Sooraj  
- **Project:** Vector Core  
- **When we meet:** TBD  
- **How to reach:** Tensor Core Discord

## Evidence

### Project Ideas
- Vector register file implementations + verification  
- Vector ALU implementation + verification  
- Vector functional units (specialized operations) implementation + verification  
- Top-level implementation with pipeline  
- Communication protocols with memory and scheduler core  
- Protocol to reuse ALU/FU hardware depending on the operation  
- Vector decoder  

**Feedback request:**  
Please let me know if I missed anything. Since there are other SD folks, we may need to extend project scope to make the vector core better.  

**Suggestion:**  
For the vector core, I want to establish strict RTL guidelines for naming conventions, coding style, macros, etc. My vision is to have the design fully parametrizable—for example, scaling from 32 lanes to 64 lanes should be as simple as changing a variable. We can create a dedicated document for this.

## Future Plans
- Begin RTL implementation  
- Assign smaller projects to team members  
- Write RTL coding guidelines document  
- Meet with Sooraj to discuss assignments  
- Finalize formal ISA
