Week 1 Design Log

State: I am not stuck with anything, don't need help right now.

Plan:

To implement convolution controller in System Verilog and synthesize the module.  
To create an interface with Scratchpad and Systolic Array to verify convolution controller works together.  

Timeline:  
9/14: Complete python simulation  
9/21: Complete RTL & FSM  
10/5: Implementation in System Verilog  
10/12: Come up with a Test Plan  
10/31: Verification and fix errors  
11/16: Integration and testing  
11/30: Fix failures and get figures  
12: Documentation + Report
