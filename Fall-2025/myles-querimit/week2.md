## State: I am not stuck with anything, don't need help right now. 

## Progress
This was the first week of me being in the Systolic Array team, leading me to have to start catching up with the rest of the team, so I could have some beneficial impact. With us meeting in person, we started to divide up responsibilities. 

## Tasks
    I will be working with Saandiya on the Tensor Computer Accelerator, aiding her in the design and the overall progress of the project. 

Papers/Documentation 
    - im2row Convolution Algorithm
        Paper that Saandiya referred to last semester for the overall CNN architecture 
    - ConvController RTL
        RTL diagram of convolution controller 
    - Systolic Array Slideshow
        General presentation regarding how the systolic array functioned. Top level overview of convlution and the overall logic. 

Estimated Schedule 
    (Rough timeline from Scratchpad Meeting)
    Sept - 
        RTL + FSM 
        Implement in SV
    Oct - 
        Test Plan
        Verify Functionality 
    Nov - 
        Test
    Dec - 
        Fix issues 
        Get data figures 

## Notes
    I was notified that we will have to fix the FSM for the CNN, as we had improper assumptions regarding on how we interacted with the Scratchpad. We assumed that all data given from the scratchpad will already masked + shifted for us, but now we will be in responsible for all of it. 

## Future Plans 
    Catch up on all of the documentation so I will be on the same track as my teammates on the Sunday meeting.
