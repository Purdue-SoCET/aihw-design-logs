# Week 2 Design Log: Mixuan Pan

## State 
I am not stuck with anything, I don't need help right now. 

## Progress 
Malcolm taught us some basic concepts about Wallace Tree Multiplier on the Thursday meeting (right after the general meeting). On the Sunday meeting, me and Vinay discussed about the implementation of a wallace tree multiplier in system verilog, and I remade the wallace tree chart in excel for a clearer understanding of the partial products' placement in each stage. 

## Notes 
- multiplication for floating points are only for decimals.
