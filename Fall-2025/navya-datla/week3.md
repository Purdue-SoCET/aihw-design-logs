State: I am currently not stuck or blocked. 

Progress This Week: 

This week on Friday and Saturday I dove into the scheduler core codebase before the AI Hardware worktime on Sunday so that I could ask some more specific questions on the functionality. I started at the top level module, and worked my way through dispatch and issue and their submodules. I prepared a lot of questions on the system to ask on Sunday. Then, on Sunday, I attended the AI Hardware worktime where Rishi answered the questions me and my team brought and discussed the current functionality of the design and some of the changes we were looking to implement this semester. I continued looking into the codebase to try and solidify more of my understanding for the rest of the meeting.

I also attended the scheduler core meeting on Tuesday where we talked about the changes that needed to be made in each stage of the schedule core and what pieces would be assigned to each team member. I along with two of my team members were assigned to work on the scoreboard, so I have continued diving deeper into understanding this part of the codebase.

I attended the SoCet Main Team meeting on Thursday where I listened to Dan Elmhurst, a former VP at Intel. He gave a lot of very interesting perspective on his experience in the industry. His advice to gain technical expertise in an area for 5-10 years before transitioning into management stuck with me as somoene who eventually wants to go into management. I also found his perspective on what missteps Intel made super fascinating. It was great to hear from someone who had been so successful in the semiconductor industry. 

Next Steps: 
- I plan to make RTL diagrams of the code so I can trace my understanding and see where I might have some residual questions and to facilitate designing changes.
- Working on my Senior Design Proposal slides and presentation.
