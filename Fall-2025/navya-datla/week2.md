State: I am currently not stuck or blocked. 

Progress This Week: 

This week I attended the ECE 437 Focus Group led by Jing. I learned more about Amdahl's law, focusing on how it's important to optimize the performance of the task that takes the most time rather than speeding up a task that takes less time way more. I also learned about the Iron Law of processor performance. We discussed a lot of the hazards that can occur when pipelining the single cycle processor, and we also discussed the basics of how caches work. It helped me get a better understanding of topics we haven't covered yet in 437 so I have some basis of the knowledge that will help me on the project. 

I also attended a meeting held by Akshath focusing on the scratchpad and how it interfaces and interacts with other components of the tensor core. I also learned about the ISAs being developed by the scratchpad and vector core that will be used by the scheduler core. 

During the scheduler core meeting, I learned more about the components of the scheduler core, and that my role will likely be on integrating different components to ensure they work well with each other. I was given access to the RTL diagrams on draw.io as well as the GitHub with all of the SystemVerilog code for the Tensor Core to look over and understand better. 

Next Steps: By the Sunday team meeting, I will review and attempt to understand the code relevant to the scheduler core, and come prepared with specific questions to ask Rishi so that I can quickly get up to speed.
