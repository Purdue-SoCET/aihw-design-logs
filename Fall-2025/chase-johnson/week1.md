Sub-Team - Vector Core
The Vector Core is a seperate piece of hardware from the rest of the tensor-core as it aims to focus on processing vector-based instructions. The purpose of the vector core is speed up AI model learning processes and work in conjunction with other pieces of hardware in the tensor core.

Goals: Want to implement and verify the vector core functional units. Implement and verify the vector core register file. Implement and verify the vector core functionality. Integrate the vector core with other components and verify functionality.

Plan For the Upcoming Fall Semester
Weeks 1-4   - RTL Implentation for all functional units. Verification of all functional units. RTL, implementation, and verification of Vector Register File.
Weeks 5-8   - Connect and intergate with other tensor-core pieces of hardware such as scratchpad, systolic array, and scheduler core.
Weeks 9-12  - Synthesis and Optimize Design to meet clock requirements.
Weeks 13-16 - Report, Final Documentation, and VIP Presentation
