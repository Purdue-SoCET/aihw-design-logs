# State:
I am not stuck with anything, don't need help right now. 

# Progress:

- Attended the scratchpad team's first meeting on Thursday. Learned some background information about the whole system and how it interfaces with the scratchpad.
- I will be working on the vector core frontend. 

# Next Steps:

- Read papers and other resources the guys said they will share with us.
- Attend the Sunday meeting where Akshath and the team will go over more details about the design.
- Discuss with the vector core team what they are looking for from my side and how they want to communicate with the scratchpad frontend.
