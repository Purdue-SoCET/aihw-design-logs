## State: 
  I am not stuck with anything, would like discuss arbitration between caches/scratchpad and look into possible solutions.

## Progress:
  This week I began with watching the DRAM youtube video that went into the basics of DRAM structure/addressing and visually demonstrated basic transactions. I then began reading the 4 assigned chapters from the Memory System book. Chapter 10 discussed the basic DRAM organization. Chapter 11 discussed the DRAM commands and all needed parameters like tRCD, tRAS, tCAS, tRP, ect. Chapter 12 discussed the evolution of DRAM devices. Chapter 13 discussed the DRAM Memory Controller and its components. 

  After reading the 4 chapters, I began to review the rtl diagrams from last years and correlating my understanding from the reading into the diagram. I am now in the process of reading the JEDEC DDR4 documentation and understanding the timing requirments needed for DDR4.
