Week 1 Design Log

State: Need more reading and information on DRAM controller requirements.

Plan: Have been assigned to update existing in-order and blocking DRAM controller into a out-of-order and non-blocking DRAM contoller. Need to understand previous implementation of DRAM contoller and spend time understanding and reading on the non-blovking functionality and implementation. Need to get an understanding of what ports are needed into the controller.
