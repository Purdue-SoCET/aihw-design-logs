## State: 
  I am not stuck with anything, would like more information on overall architecture and workloads

## Progress:
  This week I attended the ISA discussion meeting, where I was able to view the new micro architecure and get an understanding of all the sub-units. I got the chance to hear what the requirements are for the scratchpad instructions and the vector core instructions. 
  
  This helps me visualize and understand the flow of the architecture and the changes that are being made from last semester. 

  
  I also attended the first DRAM controller meeting where we discussed the current progress on the controller and what needs to be finished. We then created a timeline of about 6 weeks to complete the current version of the DRAM controller so we can begin working on the next version of the DRAM Controller. 
  
  I was able to view and get access to the RTL diagrams of the current version to understand the micro architecture. For next steps, I was able to receive a video explaining the overall theory behind of DRAM and was assigned 4 chapters (chaper 10-13) to read from "Memory systems: cache, DRAM, disk". 
  
  I was also given documentation on the Micron DRAM model that we will be utilizing, this will assist me in undestanding the timing requirments of the DRAM we will be interfacing with.
