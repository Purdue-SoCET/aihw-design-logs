State: Waiting to find out more about the software project during the coming meetings, no blockers otherwise.

Progress:
- This is my first semester in SoCET, so I am still getting my bearings and finding out more about the project and the team's structure

- Joined the software subteam to work on their compiler project to translate C code to assembly-like instructions for the hardware. This will be my senior design project

- Read chapters 7, 14, 15 of the MIT Computation Structures course
