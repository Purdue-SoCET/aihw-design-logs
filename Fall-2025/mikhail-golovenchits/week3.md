State: I am not stuck with anything. Don't need help right now.

## Progress

- Decided to fully commit to PPCI due to simplicity and need of concrete deliverables, as opposed to spending time learning LLVM (could have taken the whole semester).
- Added frontend parsing to C compiler for 'theta' instruction
- Split up the work between front end and backend. I will be working on the frontend parsing of the dummy theta instruction and then join the team in implementing the backend architecture
- Still waiting for full ISA green card to know exactly which instructions to implement

## Next steps
- Fix argument parsing in theta IR
- Work with rest of team to implement the backend
- By sunday be able to show progress with IR parsing
