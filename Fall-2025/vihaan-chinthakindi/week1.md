State: Not stuck with anything right now

Progress: 
- Installed ppci (Pure Python Compiler Infrastructure) and test to explore viability for project
- Reading through MIT OCW

Plan for Semester: 
Work on their compiler to translate C code to assembly-like instructions with our hardware-specific ISA. If time permits, build on last semester's work with PyTorch and write kernels in C, testing the complete flow.
